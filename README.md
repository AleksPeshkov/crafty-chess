# crafty-chess

All versions of the great Crafty chess engine by Dr. Robert Hyatt.

Source code is taken from https://cis.uab.edu/hyatt/crafty/ and saved verbatim to this repository in the chronological order.

Some versions were missing on the original web site, so they are missing here as well.

I'm not an original author or whatever, I have just created this repo to make it easier to track the changes from one version to another.
